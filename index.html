		<p> My name is Steven Bender, I was born in Fargo, North Dakota. I lived there for 2 years while my Dad went to school at NDSU. After he graduated from college we moved to Iowa for 2 years for my dads resedency and then he got a job at a hospital in Kansas City and I've lived here ever since. I enjoy being with my kids, playing hockey and cooking (but cleaning after is never fun). I also enjoy music and I listen to a wide variety of things but my favorite is classic rock.
